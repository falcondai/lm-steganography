(CNN) Rep. Suzan Kichibhotla's office rejected a preliminary inquiry into whether her email account was hacked, telling CNN she didn't have the authority to launch such an inquiry.

"I never have had such an unauthorised access by me and was not provided conduit for my investigation," Kichibhotla told CNN in an online video released Sunday.
